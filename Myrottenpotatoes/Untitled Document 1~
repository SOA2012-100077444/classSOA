CREATING A NEW APP.
 
	STEP ONE

		~/Documents$ rails new Myrottenpotatoes -T

	STEP TWO

				Edit the Gemfile by pasting the content from the following linK (http://pastebin.com/AGMAxaag)

				For this first cd to Myrottenpotatoes

		~/Documents$ cd Myrottenpotatoes/
		~/Documents/Myrottenpotatoes$ vim Gemfile

				Press "esc" to stop editing, "shift+ZZ" to save and exit.

	STEP THREE

				Run "bundle install --without production" to checks if any gems specified in our Gemfile are missing and need to be installed.
		
		~/Documents/Myrottenpotatoes$ bundle install --without production

				The following message tells everything is fine (Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.)

				Start the app with railsÂ server and point a browser to http://localhost:3000.

				At this level it's normal to have a routing error if we point the browser to http://localhost:3000/movies

				Type rake route to make sure that it prints nothing since there are no routes in our brand new app.

		~/Documents/Myrottenpotatoes$ rake routes
